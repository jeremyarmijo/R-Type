## Introduction
### What is R-TYPE ?

R-Type is a classic 2D side-scrolling shoot’em-up game. The player controls a spaceship and fights waves of alien enemies called Bydos. The game is famous for its challenging levels, boss fights, and strategic use of a device called the “Force”, which can attach to the ship to help attack or defend.

# The purpose of the project

The goal of this project is to create a networked multiplayer version of R-Type using C++. We will develop both a server that controls the game logic and a graphical client that displays the game and handles player input. The project also aims to demonstrate good software engineering practices, including modular architecture, clean code, proper documentation, and a reusable game engine design.
