1. Introduction
   The R-Type Network Protocol defines the communication rules between
   clients and servers for authentication, game state synchronization,
   and real-time gameplay events. The protocol uses both TCP and UDP
   to balance reliability and latency constraints.

2. Terminology
   Client: Game instance controlled by a player.
   Server: Authoritative game server.
   Payload: Message-specific data following the common header.

3. Protocol Overview
   The protocol follows a client-server architecture. Critical operations
   such as authentication and game lifecycle management are transmitted
   over TCP, while real-time gameplay data is exchanged over UDP.

4. Transport Protocols
4.1 TCP Usage
   TCP MUST be used for:
   - Authentication
   - Lobby management
   - Game start and end notifications
   - Error reporting

4.2 UDP Usage
   UDP MUST be used for:
   - Player inputs
   - Game state synchronization
   - Entity updates

5. Common Message Format
   All protocol messages share a common 6-byte header.

5.1 Header Format

8. Error Handling
   Clients receiving malformed or unknown messages SHOULD discard them
   silently. Fatal errors MUST be reported using the ERROR message over TCP.

9. Security Considerations
   Passwords MUST NOT be transmitted in plain text.
   UDP messages SHOULD be rate-limited.
   The server MUST validate all client inputs.
